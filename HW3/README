This is a simple example that demonstrates the generation of gzip file
format and block-based processing with dictionary using Java's Deflater
class. You may freely use it as a starting point of Homework 3.

To compile, executei (It will also compile the other class automatically):
$ javac JGzip.java

To run it, use:
$ java JGzip [INPUT_FILE]
It outputs to stdout, so most likely you to redirect it somewhere.

If you want to test with GraalVM to generate a native binary, use:
$ native-image JGzip
and you will get an executable called "jgzip", which functions the same way
as "java JGzip"

Note that this code does not conform to the homework spec:
1) It reads input from file instead of stdin (you need to use System.in for
   input instead)
2) It does not implement multi-threading
